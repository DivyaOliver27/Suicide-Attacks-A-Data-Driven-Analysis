# Suicide-Attacks-A-Data-Driven-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing global suicide attacks using visual data insights. The dataset includes information on the countries and cities most affected, the types of weapons.
### 📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global suicide attacks using visual data insights. The dataset includes information on the countries and cities most affected, the types of weapons used, and the gender distribution of attackers. The goal is to identify patterns, regional disparities, and trends that can inform preventative strategies and policy decisions.

### 🔑 Key Variables Explored

- Targeted countries and cities
- Types of weapons and bombing techniques
- Gender of attackers (male vs. female)
- Specific attack locations (especially in the U.S.)

### 📈 Data Visualization & Analysis

Five key visualizations were created to explore the data:

1. **Stacked Bar Chart**
    - Highlights Iraq as the country with the highest number of suicide attacks.
    - Suggests links to unemployment, political instability, and social unrest.

3. **Clustered Column Chart**
    - Displays Afghanistan as having the highest number of *male attackers*, reflecting ongoing conflict and insurgency.
    - <img width="612" alt="Highest male suicide attacks" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c97df79-080a-4c55-9379-416112bd8cf6" />

4. **Funnel Chart**
    - Breaks down attack methods: car bombs, truck bombs, and belt bombs.
    - Iraq stands out as the most affected, showing intense militant activity.

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **Iraq, Afghanistan, and Nigeria** are the most heavily impacted countries.
- Gender-based patterns show more female attackers in Nigeria, more male attackers in Afghanistan.
- Attack methods vary significantly by region, with vehicle-based bombs being most common in Iraq.
- The U.S. data shows domestic patterns of targeted attacks in specific cities.

### ✅ Conclusion

This project sheds light on the geographical and gender diversity of suicide attacks, along with the range of weapons and tactics used. The insights gained can support the development of targeted intelligence, preventative measures, and international security policies.
